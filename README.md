> [!TIP]
>
> The **2022 branch** uses ARFoundation 5.1.6 API and requires **Unity 2022.3.52f1** or newer.  
> The **main branch** uses ARFoundation 6.0 API and requires **Unity 6000.0.40f1** or newer.

## About the Project

ARFoundationSample-Unity is a collection of sample scenes developed with ARFoundation. These scenes demonstrate core functionalities such as anchors, plane detection, and camera features. Developers can quickly explore the capabilities provided by PFDM devices through these examples.

### Examples

All sample scenes can be found in the `Assets/Scenes` folder. For detailed information about ARFoundation components used in each scene, refer to the [AR Foundation Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@6.1/manual/index.html).

#### Camera

A scene demonstrating camera functionalities, including **Video See-Through (VST)** support.

#### Plane Detection

Detects and visualizes planes in the environment using ARFoundation's plane tracking system.

#### Anchors

This example shows how to create anchors at controller positions, and how to save/delete/load anchors.
> [!TIP]
>
> **Anchor saving/loading** is only available in ARFoundation 6.0+ APIs. The 2022 branch uses pre-6.0 APIs. To use this feature, switch to the **main branch** and open the project with **Unity 6** or newer.

#### Mesh

Demonstrates real-time 3D mesh generation by scanning and reconstructing real-world environments.
